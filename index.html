    <h2 class="underline">What is CSS</h2>

    <P>Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. <strong>CSS is a style sheet language</strong>. CSS is what we use to selectively style HTML elements.</P>

    <p>The whole structure is called a <strong>ruleset</strong> (The term <em>ruleset</em> is often referred to as just <em>rule</em>). Note the names of the individual parts.</p>

    <h3>Why Use CSS?</h3>
    <p>CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, the layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.</p>

    <h3>How to add CSS to HTML</h3>

    <p>When a browser reads a style sheet, it will format the HTML document according to the information in the style sheet.</p>
    <p>There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>External CSS</strong>: With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file! Each HTML page must include a reference to the external sheet file inside the link element, inside the head section.</li>
            <li><strong>Internal CSS</strong>: An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style. The internal style is defined inside the style element, inside the head section.</li>
            <li><strong>In line CSS</strong>: An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element. To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style can contain any CSS property</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Benefits from linking a CSS file to an HTML documents are:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Consistent design</strong>: Maintains formating and design consistency throughout the website. A single adjustment on CSS rules can be applied universally to multiple areas of a website.</li>
        <li><strong>Faster loading time</strong>: It only requires a single CSS file to style all HTML files. With fewer strings of code, a website can load faster. The site will also cache the CSS file for your isitors' next visit.</li>
        <li><strong>Improve SEO</strong>: Strong CSS styles in a nother file makes the HTML file more concised and organized. As a result, the website will have cleaner and more lightweight code, which results in better crawlability by search engines.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colours, layout, and fonts, thus making our web pages presentable to the users. CSS is designed to make style sheets for the web. Some elements we covered in this lessons are....</p>
    <ul>
        <li>ID selector</li>
        <li>Tag (element selector)</li>
        <li>Class selector</li>
        <li>Attribute selector</li>
    </ul>
